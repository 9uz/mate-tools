How do I tag, lemmatize, etc. a text?

= Spliting, Tagging, Morphologic Tagging and Lemmatizing =

First, the text has to be tokenized and in one word per line format. For example, the OpenNLP tokenizer could be used. The input text should looks as:  
{{{
Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands , and road systems have been expanded and im proved . <br> 
Private investment has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible . <br>
Politically , the 1990s have been relatively quite times for the islands . <br>
}}}
== From Tokenized one word sentence per line format to one-word per line 2009 CoNLL format ==

The following maps tokenized text in one-sentence-per-line format into the input format of the lemmatizer, tagger, etc.
<br>    
{{{
java -cp Documents/workspace/mate-tools/dist/anna.jar is2.util.Split one-sentence-per-line.txt > one-word-per-line.txt
}}}
