#Parser and Models for Joint Morphologic and Dependency Parsing

== Parser and Models for Joint Tagging and Dependency Parsing  ==

_Google Code closed its upload section. Hence, we have to provide the parser and models for download here._ 

This parser provides the following technology: transition-based dependency parser, beam-search and early update, graph-based completion model, joint Part-of-Speech tagging, joint Morphologic tagging, Hash-Kernel
