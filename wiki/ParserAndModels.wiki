#Parser and Models for Joint Morphologic and Dependency Parsing

== Parser and Models for Joint Tagging and Dependency Parsing  ==

_Google Code closed its upload section. Hence, we have to provide the parser and models for download here._ 

Parser uses the following technology:
  # transition-based dependency parser
  # beam-search and early update
  # graph-based completion model
  # joint Part-of-Speech tagging
  # joint Morphologic tagging
  # Hash-Kernel
