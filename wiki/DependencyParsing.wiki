*How to parse a file from the command line*

`java -Xmx3G -classpath anna.jar is2.parser.Parser -model <parsing-model> -test <input-file> -out <output-file>`

Please replace the following parts:

 * <parsing-model> is the model used by the parser to build the dependency tree (see Downloads)
 * <input-file> is read by the parser and it has to be in [http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/conll2009-st/task-description.html CoNLL-2009 one word per line format]
 * <output-file> is the parsing result and written by the parser
