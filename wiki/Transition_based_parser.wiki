#This page describes the usage of our transition-based parser (Joint Pos-Tagging / Graph-based completion model) 

= Transition-based parser including a pos-tagger and graph-based model =

Please, note that the parser is a research parser and we will provide later versions that use less memory and disc space. It is also not exactly the version, we used for our papers (Bohnet and Kuhn, 2012) nor (Bohnet and Nivre, 2012) as I fixed already a few bugs and improved the speed.

Nevertheless, for the training settings of different language, we would recommand to have a look on our paper (Bohnet and Nivre, 2012).

  # For the training, a computer with 18G free main memory is needed as we jackknife 10 taggers in the training phase; I recommand strongly to use a newer faster Intel CPU with a minimum number of 4 cores better 6.
