#This page describes the usage of our transition-based parser (Joint Pos-Tagging / Graph-based completion model) 

= General Remarks =

Please, note that this is still a research parser and we will provide later versions that use less main memory and disc space. 

It is also not exactly the version, we used for our papers (Bohnet and Kuhn, 2012; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012). I fixed already a few bugs and improved the speed.

For the training settings of language, we would recommand to have a look in our paper (Bohnet and Nivre, 2012).
